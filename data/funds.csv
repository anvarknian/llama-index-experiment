Our vision is to create an eco-system for entrepreneurs where Zenith Group can assist from seed- or some times even pre-seed rounds through A- and B-rounds to exit. Exiting entrepreneurs then get the chance to reinvest into new startup- and growth companies through Zenith Group and contribute with her/his experience and expertise to the next generation of entrepreneurs.

The first SEIS fund launched in the same year, closing oversubscribed with over £5 million invested in 35 SEIS qualifying companies.  Since then, we have raised over £18 million, which has been deployed in 115 companies.

Jenson Funding Partners is a conviction investment Company. To continue to fund the companies, we launched our EIS Fund in 2015.  We believe that there is a recognisable funding gap between SEIS and mature EIS companies; a gap that the established EIS investment companies ignore.  The opportunity afforded to Jenson is the ability to fund these companies at a fair value, rather than paying a premium due to the demand created at the mature end of the investable market.

Jenson Funding Partners access the potential investee companies from a number of sources and reviews over 1,000 pitches a year. Having made an investment they then wrap a support structure around that business to give it the greatest chance of achieving its growth potential.","Runway East 58 City Road London EC1Y 2AL England, United Kingdom","United Kingdom, England, Oxford","https://twitter.com/jensonfunding","","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/jenson-funding-partners","","","","","","","Venture Capital","Pre-Seed

Mekong Capital’s investee companies are typically among the fastest growing and market leading companies in Vietnam’s consumer-driven sectors such as retail, restaurants, consumer products and distribution.

Established in 2001, Mekong Capital has the most extensive private equity track record in Vietnam. Our funds have completed more than 41 private equity investments, of which 27 have been fully exited. Mekong Capital has managed 5 funds, one of which is currently making new investments. Mekong Capital has a team of 60+ full-time people in our offices in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and our Seniors have an average tenure at Mekong Capital of around 7 years. Mekong's four Partners have a combined 57 years at Mekong Capital.

Mekong Capital invests in fast-growing companies, with ambitious expansion plans, and a strong commitment to building management teams that will apply best practices and successfully execute on those expansion plans. These companies are typically well-established companies in their sectors, but which typically operate in fragmented and fast growing markets which present attractive growth opportunities.

Mekong Capital is strongly committed to adding significant value at each of its investee companies – through operational improvements, building management teams, introduction of best practices and outside experts, and applying other elements of our Vision Driven Investing framework.","","Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City","https://twitter.com/Mekong_Capital","https://www.facebook.com/MekongCapital","https://www.instagram.com/mekongcapital_official","https://www.linkedin.com/company/mekongcapital","https://medium.com/mekongcapital/the-world-of-ontological-private-equity-5fedab8e8be6","","info@mekongcapital.com","","","+84 28 3827 3161","Private Equity Firm","Private Equity","","10994","","2001","51-200","Service
